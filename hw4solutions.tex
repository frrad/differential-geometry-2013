\section{In dimensions $4n$ we have that the Hodge $*$ : $H^{2n}(M) \to H^{2n}(M)$ satisfies $**=I.$ The difference in the dimensions of the eigenspaces for $\pm 1$ is called the \emph{signature} of $M:$ $$\tau(M) = \sigma(M) = \dim( \ker (*-I) - \ker (*+I)).$$ One can show that this does not depend on the metric used to define $*$, by observing that it is the index of the symmetric bilinear map $$H^{2n}(M) \times H^{2n}(M) \to \R, $$ $$(\omega_1, \omega_2) \to \int \omega_1 \wedge \omega_2.$$ Recall that the index of a symmetric bilinear map is the difference between positive and negative diagonal elements when it has been put into diagonal form. In dimension 4 one can show that $$\sigma(M) = \frac{1}{12 \pi^2} \int_M \left(  \left| W^+ \right|^2 - \left| W^- \right|^2 \right).$$ Using the exercises from chapter 4, show that for an Einstein metric in dimension 4 we have $$\chi(M) \geq \frac{3}{2} \sigma(M),$$ with equality holding iff the metric is Ricci flat and $W^-=0.$ Conclude that not all four manifolds admit Einstein metrics. In higher dimensions there are no known obstructions to the existence of Einstein metrics. \hint{consider connected sums of $\CP^2$ with itself $k$ times.}}

\section{Describe all harmonic forms on the following Riemannian manifolds:}
\subsection{The torus $T^n = S^1 \times \cdots \times S^1$ with the flat product metric;}
\subsection{The sphere $S^n$ with its round metric;}
\subsection{\label{f-study}The complex projective space $\CP^n$ with the Fubini-Study metric.}
\subsection*{Feel free to use (without proof) the computation of the deRham cohomology groups of these spaces. Thus, in each case it suffices to exhibit a basis of harmonic forms of the required cardinality.  \hint{For \ref{f-study}, consider the powers of the K\"ahler form.}}

\section{Show that the Laplacian on forms commutes with the Hodge star operator.}

\section{Consider the Laplacian $\Delta: \Omega^p(M) \to \Omega^p(M)$, where $M$ is a closed, oriented Riemannian manifold.}
\subsection{Prove that the eigenvalues of $\Delta$ are nonnegative, and have no finite accumulation points.}
\subsection{Prove that the eigenspaces of $\Delta$ are finite dimensional.}
\subsection{Prove that the eigenspaces corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.}
\section*{\note{It can also be shown that $\Delta$ has infinitely many eigenvalues, and that the direct sum of all eigenspaces is dense in $\Omega^p(M)$. If you are interested, see Exercise 16 on p.254 in Warner, ``Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups''}}

\section{Let $M$ be a closed, oriented, Riemannian 4-manifold. Let us identify $H^2(M; \R)$ with the space of harmonic 2-forms using the Hodge theorem. Note that the star operator $*$ acting on $\Omega^2(M; \R)$ satisfies $*^2 =1$, and therefore we have a direct sum decomposition $$\Omega^2(M; \R) = \Omega^+(M) \oplus \Omega^- (M),$$ where $\Omega^\pm$ are the eigenspaces of $*$ corresponding to the eigenvalues $\pm 1$. Restricting this decomposition to harmonic forms, we obtain another direct sum decomposition $$H^2(M; \R) = \mathcal{H}^+ \oplus \mathcal{H}^-,$$ where $\mathcal{H}^\pm$ are the eigenspace of $*$ acting on $H^2(M; \R)$, corresponding to eigenvalues $\pm 1$. \\\\ Let $d^+ : \Omega^1(M) \to \Omega^+(M)$ be the composition of $d$ with orthogonal projection to $\Omega^+$, and consider the three-term complex $$\Omega^0(M) \stackrel{d}{\to} \Omega^1(M) \stackrel{d^+}{\to} \Omega^+(M).$$ Show that the cohomology groups of this complex can be naturally identified with $H^0(M; \R)$, $H^1(M; \R)$, and $\mathcal{H}^+(M)$, respectively.}
